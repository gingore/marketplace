# Message Sending Fix Summary

## Problem
The contact form for sending messages to sellers was failing with the error:
```
"Could not find the 'buyer_name' column of 'messages' in the schema cache"
```

## Root Cause
This was a Supabase schema cache issue. The `buyer_name` column was added to the `messages` table via a migration (`add-buyer-name-column.sql`), but Supabase's schema cache wasn't updated to reflect this change. This resulted in a mismatch between the actual database schema and what the Supabase client believed the schema to be.

## Solution
Instead of trying to fix the schema cache (which would require Supabase CLI access or dashboard admin privileges), we implemented a workaround:

### API Changes (`src/app/api/messages/route.ts`)
1. Made `buyer_name` an optional field instead of required
2. When `buyer_name` is provided, it gets included in the message text with format: `"From: [buyer_name]\n\n[original_message]"`
3. Updated validation to not require `buyer_name`

### Frontend Changes (`src/app/item/[id]/page.tsx`)
1. Changed from direct Supabase client calls to using the API endpoint
2. Removed debug logging
3. Maintained the same user experience - buyer name is still collected and sent

## Result
- Message sending now works reliably through the API endpoint
- Buyer names are preserved in the message content
- No data loss or user experience degradation
- Avoids the schema cache issue entirely

## Messages Table Schema
Current working schema (without buyer_name column in the database structure):
```sql
CREATE TABLE messages (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  listing_id UUID REFERENCES listings(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  buyer_email VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
  seller_email VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
  message TEXT NOT NULL,
  created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW()
);
```

Buyer names are included in the `message` field when provided.

## Testing
- ✅ API endpoint works: `POST /api/messages`
- ✅ Frontend form sends messages successfully
- ✅ Messages are stored and retrievable
- ✅ Buyer names are preserved in message content
- ✅ No schema cache errors
