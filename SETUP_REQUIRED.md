# ðŸš¨ URGENT: Database Setup Required

## The Issue
You're seeing these errors because the Supabase database tables haven't been created properly:
- "Could not find the 'seller_email' column" or "Could not find the 'buyer_name' column"
- Loading/error loops in the interface
- "Bucket not found" for image uploads

## âœ… Quick Fix (5 minutes)

### 1. Set Up Database Tables
1. **Go to your Supabase Dashboard** â†’ [supabase.com/dashboard](https://supabase.com/dashboard)
2. **Open your project**
3. **Go to SQL Editor** (left sidebar)
4. **Copy the entire contents** of `database.sql` from this project
5. **Paste and click "Run"**
6. **Wait for "Success. No rows returned"** message

### 2. Update Existing Tables (If Needed)
If you have existing tables that are missing columns, run the `add-buyer-name-column.sql` script to add the missing `buyer_name` column to the messages table.

### 3. Refresh Schema Cache
1. **Go to Settings â†’ API** in your Supabase dashboard
2. **Find "Schema Cache" section**
3. **Click "Reload Schema"**
4. **Wait 30 seconds**

### 4. Set Up Image Storage
1. **Go to Storage** in Supabase dashboard
2. **Create new bucket** named `listing-images` (not `images`)
3. **Make it public** âœ…
4. **Policies are already set up** in the SQL script

### 4. Test Your App
```bash
# Test the database connection
curl http://localhost:3000/api/listings

# Should return: {"success":true,"data":[],"pagination":{...}}
```

## âš¡ Alternative: Use Sample Data
The `database.sql` script includes sample listings so you can see the app working immediately!
